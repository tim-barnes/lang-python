# lang-python
This repo collects together random reminders and experiments in Python 2/3.  It is not intended to be educational, interesting or contain any particular merit.  *Note:*  This repo is not formally maintained.  I may occassionally dump futher experiments in here when I develop them.

Not all the code works.  Not all the code is documented.  Some code may require installing additional modules to run.
